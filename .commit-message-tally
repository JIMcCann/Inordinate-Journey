When there's need for an announcement of some kind,
perhaps of some changes for which -m is not supported,
we can just edit this file so that we have changes to commit,
so that we can make a commit to attach the announcement to.
This file will double as a tally of the number of times
this has been necessary.

Times we've needed to exploit .commit-message-tally: 2
