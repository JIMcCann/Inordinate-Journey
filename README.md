# Inordinate Journey

Hi. We're Team Triangle.
Welcome to our class project for UCSC CMPM/ARTG 120 Spring 2018.

## Important license info

Before using any of our code, please take a look at LICENSE.md.
Although at least one of us is a proponent of FOSS,
it's a philosophy that doesn't apply well to some circumstances,
and a university class project is one of them.
We take our education seriously,
and plagiarism is a threat to the integrity of our work.

## How to install and run

You will need server software and a fairly recent web browser.
Extract the repository to anywhere.
Optional: for audio, download all the files from
[this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DchB7iDGFa6uyhD2mwipnPnNXuualeTm)
and put them in (repository root)/assets/audio.
Finally, start the server, point the browser to the server,
and navigate in-browser to the root directory of the extracted repository.

## How to play

Use the arrowkeys to move and jump.
Input interpretation depends on direction of gravity, which sometimes changes.
Avoid things that look painful, survive until the shining purple rift in spacetime appears,
and use it to reach the next level.
